Following control character sequences available during serialiazation of data
trough PropertyTree (using PropertyI/OArchive-s). Label of the serialized value
should start with sequence of such characters. 

List of characters:
 "&" - Put value to the "digest" of parent element.
	   Digest shown as gray text following the name of the parent. Useful to
	   show content of the structure without need to open it.
 
 "!" - Read only field. Prevents user from changing value of the field. 
	   Doesn't affect nested members.

 "!!" - Text field looks like read only, but can be changed with F2
 
 "^" - Pull up the row. The row will appear in the same line with parent one, after it's value.
	   Works for containers as well.

 "^^" - Put value of a child element before name of the parent.
 
 "<" - Expand value field to maximal width. Handeful for long fields.
	   label can contain only "<" character, in this case the whole line will
	   be occupied with the value.

 ">" - Set widget size to minimal, it will not resize anymore.
 ">size>" - Set minimal widget width to "size".
 
 "~" - Temporary element (with null Serializer).
 
 "[controls]" - Forward control characters to container elements.

Examples:

	// will bring the Name to the line of parent structure
	ar(name_, "name", "^Name"); 

	// appears as nameless, read-only, full-line value field
	ar(description_, "description", "!<");
